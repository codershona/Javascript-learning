Given an integer k, return the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to k. The same Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

The Fibonacci numbers are defined as:

F1 = 1
F2 = 1
Fn = Fn-1 + Fn-2 for n > 2.
It is guaranteed that for the given constraints we can always find such Fibonacci numbers that sum up to k.
 

Example 1:

Input: k = 7
Output: 2 
Explanation: The Fibonacci numbers are: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ... 
For k = 7 we can use 2 + 5 = 7.
Example 2:

Input: k = 10
Output: 2 
Explanation: For k = 10 we can use 2 + 8 = 10.
Example 3:

Input: k = 19
Output: 3 
Explanation: For k = 19 we can use 1 + 5 + 13 = 19.



console.log(k);






// Math 2


// A sequence x1, x2, ..., xn is Fibonacci-like if:

// n >= 3
// xi + xi+1 == xi+2 for all i + 2 <= n
// Given a strictly increasing array arr of positive integers forming a sequence, return the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of arr. If one does not exist, return 0.

// A subsequence is derived from another sequence arr by deleting any number of elements (including none) from arr, without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3, 5, 8] is a subsequence of [3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8].

 

// Example 1:

// Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
// Output: 5
// Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,2,3,5,8].
// Example 2:

// Input: arr = [1,3,7,11,12,14,18]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: The longest subsequence that is fibonacci-like: [1,11,12], [3,11,14] or [7,11,18].
