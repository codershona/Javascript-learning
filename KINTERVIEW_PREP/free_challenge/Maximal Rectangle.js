Given a rows x cols binary matrix filled with 0's and 1's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

 

Example 1:


Input: matrix = [["1","0","1","0","0"],["1","0","1","1","1"],["1","1","1","1","1"],["1","0","0","1","0"]]
Output: 6
Explanation: The maximal rectangle is shown in the above picture.
Example 2:

Input: matrix = [["0"]]
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: matrix = [["1"]]
Output: 1
 

SOLUTION:

Complexity Analysis:  

Time Complexity: O(R x C). 
Only one traversal of the matrix is required, so the time complexity is O(R X C)
Space Complexity: O(C). 
Stack is required to store the columns, so so space complexity is O(C)
